# TrashTattle

TrashTattle is a mobile app that combines the power of public accountability with a dash of humor. This app enables users to capture photographic evidence of individuals caught red-handed dumping trash in public places. While the app is presented in a playful tone, its core mission is to promote environmental cleanliness and civic responsibility.

## Core Features
- **SnitchCam™** : A discreet camera mode that allows users to take high-resolution pictures of offenders without drawing attention. The app automatically blurs faces to protect privacy (but not their dignity).
- **TrashPin Locator** : After capturing evidence, users can pin the exact location of the incident using GPS coordinates. The app overlays a satirical “Dirty Deeds Map” to highlight public littering hotspots.
- **Address Allegator** : Using AI-powered trash analysis (because litter speaks volumes), users can input clues like vehicle license plates or distinguishable features. The app allegedly triangulates where the offender might reside based on public records, adding a playful disclaimer: "We’re not saying this is their house, but it might be.
- **Petty Points System** : Users earn points for every valid submission, leveling up from Neighborhood Watcher to Snitch Supreme. Points can be redeemed for eco-friendly rewards like reusable bags or compost kits.
- **Litter Leaderboards** : Communities can compete to see who has the cleanest streets (or the most "snitches"). The top contributors are awarded the coveted Golden Garbage Crown—because every tattler deserves their throne.
- **Cleanup Crew Calls** : For offenders who repent, TrashTattle offers a feature for scheduling local community service, like joining a neighborhood cleanup. Redemption never looked so clean.
- **Anonymous Mode** : In the spirit of the Thank You for Not Snitching culture, the app allows users to submit evidence anonymously. But beware: anonymous submissions get a cheeky stamp labeled *"Silent Snitchin"*
- **Public Shaming Wall** : With community approval, certain cases can be posted (anonymized) on the Wall of Shame to educate others. Remember: it’s not just about snitching; it’s about teaching.

## Disclaimer:
While the app embraces satire, its mission is serious: to combat illegal dumping and promote community-driven accountability. It’s not about getting people in trouble; it’s about making sure the Earth doesn’t stay in one.
